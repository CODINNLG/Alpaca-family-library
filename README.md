The repo contains:

- The [52K data](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca#data-release) used for fine-tuning the model.
- The code for [generating the data](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca#data-generation-process).

![Stanford-Alpaca](./assets/logo.png)

The current Alpaca model is fine-tuned from a 7B LLaMA model [1] on 52K instruction-following data generated by the techniques in the Self-Instruct [2] paper, with some modifications that we discuss in the next section. In a preliminary human evaluation, we found that the Alpaca 7B model behaves similarly to the `text-davinci-003` model on the Self-Instruct instruction-following evaluation suite [2].

## Alpaca model fine-tuned for application

A series of fine-tuned models derived from the Alpaca model. Some of them have publicly available weights, are fine-tuned for specific domains, and have better performance. These types of models are still being continuously developed.

### Alpaca-LoRA: Low-Rank LLaMA Instruct-Tuning

Contains:  `Dataset`, `Data Genrating Code`, `Finetune Code`, `Model Weight`, `LoRA`

- Github Page: https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora
- Discord Community: [here](https://discord.gg/prbq284xX5)
- Model: **[here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/tloen/alpaca-lora)**

This repository contains code for reproducing the [Stanford Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca) results using [low-rank adaptation (LoRA)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685.pdf). Alpaca-LoRA provide an Instruct model of similar quality to `text-davinci-003` that can run [on a Raspberry Pi](https://twitter.com/miolini/status/1634982361757790209) (for research), and the code is easily extended to the `13b`, `30b`, and `65b` models.

In addition to the training code, which runs within five hours on a single RTX 4090, Alpaca-LoRA publish a script for downloading and inference on the foundation model and LoRA, as well as the resulting [LoRA weights themselves](https://huggingface.co/tloen/alpaca-lora-7b/tree/main). To fine-tune cheaply and efficiently, Alpaca-LoRA use Hugging Face's [PEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) as well as Tim Dettmers' [bitsandbytes](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes).

Without hyperparameter tuning, the LoRA model produces outputs comparable to the Stanford Alpaca model.

Contains:  `Dataset`,  `Finetune Code`, `Model Weight`,  `Web Demo`

This work collected more than 700 diseases and their corresponding symptoms, recommended medications, and required medical tests, and then generated 5K doctor-patient conversations. By fine-tuning models of doctor-patient conversations, these models emerge with great potential to understand patients' needs, provide informed advice, and offer valuable assistance in a variety of medical-related fields. The integration of these advanced language models into healthcare can revolutionize the way healthcare professionals and patients communicate, ultimately improving the overall quality of care and patient outcomes.

Contains:  `Model Weight`, `LoRA`,

To promote open research of large models in the Chinese NLP community, this project has open-sourced the **Chinese LLaMA model and the Alpaca large model with instruction fine-tuning**. These models expand the Chinese vocabulary based on the original LLaMA and use Chinese data for secondary pre-training, further enhancing Chinese basic semantic understanding. Additionally, the project uses Chinese instruction data for fine-tuning on the basis of the Chinese LLaMA, significantly improving the model's understanding and execution of instructions.

## Some Large Language Models

Large language models provide powerful foundational capabilities for generative models and are also the basis for model fine-tuning. It is difficult to define what scale of language model can be considered a large language model, as the size of the model's parameters is related to the industry's hardware level (computing power). The scale of large models continues to evolve, and definitions are changing. In addition to OpenAI's GPT series available through an interface, this article lists some other excellent downloadable model weights for commonly used large language models.

Compared to the relatively closed usage of OpenAI's model, fine-tuning this type of language model is also a good choice.

ChatGLM-6B is an open-source, bilingual (Chinese and English) conversational language model based on the General Language Model (GLM) architecture with 6.2 billion parameters. With model quantization technology, users can deploy it locally on consumer-grade graphics cards (with a minimum of only 6GB VRAM at INT4 quantization level). ChatGLM-6B uses similar techniques to ChatGPT and has been optimized for Chinese question answering and dialogue. After training on approximately 1 trillion identifiers in both Chinese and English, combined with supervised fine-tuning, feedback self-help, human feedback reinforcement learning technologies, the 62 billion parameter ChatGLM-6B can generate responses that are quite consistent with human preferences.

## Some Resources for Instruction Fine-tuning.

### üóÇÔ∏è LlamaIndex ü¶ô (GPT Index)

LlamaIndex is a simple, flexible interface between your external data and LLMs. It provides the following tools in an easy-to-use fashion:

- Offers **data connectors** to your existing data sources and data formats (API's, PDF's, docs, SQL, etc.)
- Provides indices over your unstructured and structured data for use with LLM's. These indices help to abstract away common boilerplate and pain points for in-context learning:
  - Storing context in an easy-to-access format for prompt insertion.
  - Dealing with prompt limitations (e.g. 4096 tokens for Davinci) when context is too big.
  - Dealing with text splitting.
- Provides users an interface to **query** the index (feed in an input prompt) and obtain a knowledge-augmented output.
- Offers you a comprehensive toolset trading off cost and performance
